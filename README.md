# Part 3 exercises from Full Stack Open course
## Deployment of the phonebook app backend in Render 
In this part of the course it was recommended to complete all the exercises of part 3 in a new repository (and to place the source code directly in the root of the repository),
so as not to have problems with the deployment in Render.
