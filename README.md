# Part 3 exercises from Full Stack Open course
## Render deployment of the phonebook app backend
In this part of the course it was recommended to complete all the exercises of part 3 in a new repository (and to place the source code directly in the root of the repository),
so as not to have problems with the deployment in Render.

### Render deployment URL: (https://phonebook-backend-render-azg2.onrender.com)
